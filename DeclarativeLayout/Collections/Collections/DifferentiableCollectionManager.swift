     Method for updating the data in the table. Calculates a `Collectionmodication` between the current `collection` and new value to apply to the table.
     
     - note: If you know the modification to be applied (such as in response to an update in model from CoreData) then it can be more efficient to set `self.collection` and call `tableView.apply(modifications:animated)` manually.
     
     - parameter to: A new version of the data to show.
     - parameter animated: Flag for whether the change should be animated or whether the data should just be reloaded.
     
     - seealso: `tableView.apply(modifications:animated:)`
