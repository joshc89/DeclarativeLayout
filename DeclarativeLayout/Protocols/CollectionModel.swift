/**
 
 Protocol defining the requirements of an object that can populate a 'collection' such as a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`. 
 
 This is used to decouple default implementations of data sources from the type of data that is being used to populate the collection. In turn this allows for an abstract model object to be used to declaratively declare a collection such as a table or collection view.
 
 This protocol has an associated type, `Element`. If you are defining a list with multiple types in it (such as multiple post types, objects & advert panels) the associated `Element` type should be specified as an enum.
 
 For objects that want to hold a reference to a `CollectionModel` but cannot themselves be generic (such as `UIViewController`s from a storyboard) the type erased `AnyCollection` is provided.

 - seealso: `TableLayout`
 - seealso: `ArrayCollection`
