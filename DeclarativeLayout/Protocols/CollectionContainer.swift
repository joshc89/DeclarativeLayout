/**
 
 Convenience type that defines a container of a `CollectionModel` and provides default implementations for each of the protocol methods to forward them to the contained `collection`. 
 
 This is useful for objects that hold a `CollectionModel`, such as a View Model that performs a network request a retains the result of that request.
 
 - note: The current version of Swift does not allow for a protocol to have an inheritance clause, hence this protocol extends `CollectionModel`.
